We are truly sorry to inform that we previously stored the optimal data from 20 independent runs in a single folder, but unfortunately, this folder was accidentally deleted during the data organization process. To rectify this mistake, we have reproduced the relevant data based on the total cost. Ultimately, the deviation of the total cost in the reproduced data from that in the original data is roughly controlled within Â±0.5. The data obtained from the reproduction is stored in the "best" folder.
